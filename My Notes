Making a grid with bootstrap using the colume (col) class. Video 74.
The outter <div> is the row on the website that the inner <div>s are split up on.
You can specify the width of a colume by using a number. If you don't, the website will size them evenly, automatically Vid 74.
You can only put 12 col going across. The col have a number from 1-12 which determines the amount of space in the row it will
take up.
Adding the class="col-md-6" allows the columes to move when on an tablet or phone. The md stands for meddle, tablet size or
smaller. lg (large) stands for desktop or laptop.
If I put the col to lg then I have to put the number to 3 if i want four squares going across in a row on the wibsite on a
desktop or laptop. col-md-4 for tablet if i want 3 square going across, not phone, written in the same class for each inner <div>.
col-sm-6 is for phone, if i want 2 squares going across.  see Video 74.
col by itself is automatically divided by the computer going across and unresponsive on table and phone.
col-6 divids the columes in half and are unresponsive to table and phone.
If you don't specify any columes it default to 100%.
